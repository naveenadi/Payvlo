## 🎯 Goals

### **Primary Goal**: GST-Compliant Invoice System

Build a lightweight, cross-platform invoice generator that handles Indian GST calculations, generates compliant PDFs, and works seamlessly as both web and desktop application.

### **Technical Goals**:

- **🏗️ Architecture**: SvelteKit + Tauri + SQLite for optimal performance
- **📱 Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux desktop + web deployment
- **📊 GST Compliance**: CGST, SGST, IGST calculations with HSN/SAC codes
- **📄 PDF Generation**: Professional, GST-compliant invoice templates
- **💾 Data Management**: Local SQLite with optional cloud sync

### **Performance Targets**:

- App size: < 5MB
- Memory usage: < 100MB idle
- Startup time: < 1 second
- PDF generation: < 2 seconds per invoice

## 📝 Notes

**Key Constraints & Decisions**:

- **GST Compliance**: Must follow CBIC guidelines for invoice format
- **Offline-First**: Primary SQLite storage for reliability
