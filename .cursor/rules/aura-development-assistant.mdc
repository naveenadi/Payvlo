- **Next Merge**: [Current phase] completion → Pull Request → Main

**Development Process**:
1. **Feature Branch**: Each phase gets its own feature branch
2. **Iterative Commits**: Small, focused commits with clear messages
3. **CI/CD Validation**: All tests must pass before merge
4. **Pull Request**: Code review and approval before merging to main
5. **Clean History**: Squash merge for clean main branch history
```
